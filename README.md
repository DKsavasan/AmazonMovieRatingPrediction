# CS506 Midterm

The goal of this kaggle competition is to implement a predictive model that estimates the star rating (score) of a movie based on user reviews by using the initial features:‘Id’, ‘UserId’, ‘Time’, ‘ProductId’, ‘HelpfulnessNumerator’, ‘HelpfulnessDenominator’, ‘Summary’, ‘Text, and ’’Score’.


Analysis.ipynb contains all the pre-analysis that I did on the dataset to understand what features to extract.
SubmissionNotebook.ipynb is the final version that produced my greatest submission on Kaggle.
